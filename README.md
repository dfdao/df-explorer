## dfdao Arena Update

For dfdao's [arena](https://arena.dfdao.xyz/) mode, we reduced the MimC hashing difficulty from 220 rounds to 5.  

This fork of `df-explorer` will work for Arena matches. *DO NOT USE THIS FOR NORMAL DARK FOREST*.  

*ALSO DO NOT USE THE DARK FOREST REMOTE EXPLORER FOR ARENA -> YOU WILL GET THE WRONG MAP DATA*.
